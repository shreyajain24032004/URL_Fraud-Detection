# 🔒 URL Fraud Detection

URL Fraud Detection is a machine learning project that identifies phishing and malicious URLs to protect users from online scams. 🛡️  

It analyzes URL features like length, presence of HTTPS, and suspicious patterns to predict whether a website is **legitimate** ✅ or **fraudulent** ❌.


## 📌 Overview
Phishing attacks are a major threat to internet users, tricking them into revealing sensitive information such as passwords and financial data.  

This project builds a predictive model using machine learning techniques to classify URLs as either **safe** or **malicious**. It can be used as a standalone tool or integrated into browsers and web applications for real-time protection.
